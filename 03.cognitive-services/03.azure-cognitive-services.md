## What are Azure Cognitive Services

*Azure Cognitive Services* are APIs, SDKs, and services available to help developers build intelligent applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge.
Azure Cognitive Services enable developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications.
The goal of Azure Cognitive Services is to help developers create applications that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.
The *catalog* of services within Azure Cognitive Services can be categorized into five main pillars - *Vision, Speech, Language, Web Search, and Decision*.
