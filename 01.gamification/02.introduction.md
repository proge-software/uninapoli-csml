## Bots

Internet bot, web robot, robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet.
Typically, bots perform tasks that are simple and repetitive, much faster than a person could. The most extensive use of bots is for web crawling, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers. More than half of all web traffic is generated by bots.

### Chatbot

A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech.
Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various purposes including customer service, request routing, or for information gathering.
While some chatbot applications use extensive word-classification processes, Natural Language processors, and sophisticated AI, others simply scan for general keywords and generate responses using common phrases obtained from an associated library or database.

The creation and implementation of chatbots is heavily related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.
