## APIs

### Text Analytics

The Text Analytics API is a cloud-based service that provides advanced natural language processing over raw text, and includes four main functions: sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection, and named entity recognition.

[Use the Text Analytics containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-install-containers) to extract key phrases, detect language, and analyze sentiment locally, by installing standardized Docker containers closer to your data.

#### Sentiment Analysis

Use [sentiment analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-sentiment-analysis) to find out what customers think of your brand or topic by analyzing raw text for clues about positive or negative sentiment. 
This API returns a sentiment score between 0 and 1 for each document, where 1 is the most positive.
The analysis models are pretrained using an extensive body of text and natural language technologies from Microsoft.
For [selected languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/text-analytics-supported-languages), the API can analyze and score any raw text that you provide, directly returning results to the calling application.

#### Key Phrase Extraction

Automatically [extract key phrases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-keyword-extraction) to quickly identify the main points.
For example, for the input text "The food was delicious and there were wonderful staff", the API returns the main talking points: "food" and "wonderful staff".

#### Language Detection

You can [detect which language the input text is written in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-language-detection) and report a single language code for every document submitted on the request in a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages.
The language code is paired with a score indicating the strength of the score.

#### Named Entity Recognition

[Identify and categorize entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-entity-linking) in your text as people, places, organizations, date/time, quantities, percentages, currencies, and more. Well-known entities are also recognized and linked to more information on the web.


### Language Understanding (LUIS)

Language Understanding (LUIS) is a cloud-based API service that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information.

A client application for LUIS is any conversational application that communicates with a user in natural language to complete a task.

Once the LUIS app is published, a client application sends utterances (text) to the LUIS natural language processing endpoint API and receives the results as JSON responses.
A common client application for LUIS is a chat bot.

|Step|Action|
|:--|:--|
|1|The client application sends the user _utterance_ (text in their own words), "I want to call my HR rep." to the LUIS endpoint as an HTTP request.|
|2|LUIS enables you to craft your custom language models to add intelligence to your application. Machine learned language models take the user's unstructured input text and returns a JSON-formatted response, with a top intent, `HRContact`. The minimum JSON endpoint response contains the query utterance, and the top scoring intent. It can also extract data such as the _Contact Type_ entity.|
|3|The client application uses the JSON response to make decisions about how to fulfill the user's requests. These decisions can include decision tree in the bot framework code and calls to other services. |

The LUIS app provides intelligence so the client application can make smart choices. LUIS doesn't provide those choices.


### Translator Text

The [Translator Text API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-info-overview) allows you to add multi-language user experiences in [more than 60 languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/languages), and can be used on any hardware platform with any operating system for text-to-text language translation.

The Translator Text API is part of the Azure [Cognitive Services API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/?pivot=products&panel=ai) collection of machine learning and AI algorithms in the cloud, and is readily consumable in your development projects.
