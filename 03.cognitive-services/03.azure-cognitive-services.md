## What are Azure Cognitive Services

*Azure Cognitive Services* are APIs, SDKs, and services available to help developers build intelligent applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge.
Azure Cognitive Services enable developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications.
The goal of Azure Cognitive Services is to help developers create applications that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.
The *catalog* of services within Azure Cognitive Services can be categorized into five main pillars - *Vision, Speech, Language, Web Search, and Decision*.

### SDKs and API Specification

Most packages in the SDKs are generated from [Azure API specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) using [Azure/autorest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest).

The SDK codebase adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and thus avoids breaking changes other than at major (x.0.0) releases.
Because Azure's APIs are updated frequently, Microsoft releases a new major version at the end of each month with a full changelog.
For more details and background see [SDK Update Practices](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/wiki/SDK-Update-Practices).

On Github it is also possible to find the repositories of the implementations of the azure sdks for different languages.
To obtain this list of repos you can go to the [Azure Github account page](https://github.com/Azure) and query the list of repositories for "[azure-sdk-for](https://github.com/Azure?q=azure-sdk-for&type=&language=)".

Actually the following repos exist:
